# About the React Application Test

Congratulations on making your way to here! On this step, we will be taking a look at your coding skills. So, without further do, let's talk about the test!

## The test

### You will be making a... **Pokedex**!

To accomplish this, you will need to use [PokéApi](https://pokeapi.co/), to get the necessary data about the pokemons.

### Details

  - The application needs to allow the user to search for a specific Pokémon.
  - It should list Pokémons, and allow the user to get more information about them.
  - When displaying a single pokemon, the app needs to show: 
    - Name
    - Pokémon Type
    - Both normal and shiny sprites, but the user should be able to choose between them.
    - The stats from the Pokémon
  - The design is totally up to you! We are not asking for the greatest Pokédex of all time, so don't worry, we are looking for a developer, not a designer. But here is a tip: try something clean and with the colors from the game!

### Technologies

Ok, so now that you know what to do, lets talk about how you will make it!

You need to use:
  - React
  - Typescript
  - Styled Components

If you manage to use docker for bringing up the application, it will be really great! But don't worry, this is not required.

### Getting started

To get started, just fork this repository and start coding! Whenever you finish it, just send me an email at _edilson@quicktech.no_ and i'll take a look at your code.

I wish you the best of luck!

###### Gotta ~~catch~~ code 'em all!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
